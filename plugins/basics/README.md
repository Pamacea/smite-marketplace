# SMITE - Essential Development Commands

Essential Claude Code commands for rapid, systematic development.

## Overview

This plugin provides a collection of high-quality, battle-tested commands for your `~/.claude/commands/` directory. These are the default SMITE commands that complement SMITE agents and provide proven workflows for common development tasks.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Install the plugin
/plugin install basics@smite

# 2. Run the installer command
/smite
```

That's it! The `/smite` command automatically installs all 11 development commands to your `~/.claude/commands/` directory.

**Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### `/epct` - Systematic Implementation
Structured 4-phase workflow for complex features.
- **Best for**: Multi-file changes, thorough implementation
- **Workflow**: Explore → Plan → Code → Test
- **Philosophy**: Correctness > Speed

### 🔍 Exploration & Analysis

#### `/explore` - Deep Codebase Exploration
Comprehensive context gathering from codebase, docs, and web.
- **Best for**: Understanding new projects, finding patterns
- **Features**: Parallel agent execution, multi-source research
- **Output**: Structured findings with file references

#### `/explain-architecture` - Architecture Analysis
Identify and explain architectural patterns and design decisions.
- **Best for**: Onboarding, documentation, code review
- **Features**: Pattern recognition, ASCII diagrams, trade-offs
- **Output**: Comprehensive architecture documentation

### 🐛 Debugging

#### `/debug` - Systematic Bug Debugging
Deep analysis and resolution of bugs with root cause mapping.
- **Best for**: Complex bugs, production issues
- **Features**: ULTRA-THINK analysis, "WHY" technique (5x deep)
- **Output**: Root cause → Minimal targeted fix

### 📝 Documentation & Memory

#### `/claude-memory` - CLAUDE.md Management
Create and maintain CLAUDE.md files following best practices.
- **Best for**: Project setup, knowledge transfer
- **Features**: Global/folder-specific, best practice templates

- **Output**: Clean git history

#### `/create-pull-request` - PR Creation
Create and push PRs with auto-generated descriptions.
- **Best for**: Team collaboration, code review
- **Features**: Auto-title, diff analysis, issue links
- **Output**: Professional PR ready for review

#### `/run-tasks` - GitHub Issue Execution

## Command Selection Guide

| Situation | Use Command |
|-----------|-------------|
| Quick feature or fix | `/oneshot` |
| Complex feature (2-5 files) | `/epct` |
| Understanding codebase | `/explore` |
| Documenting architecture | `/explain-architecture` |
| Bug investigation | `/debug` |
| Project setup | `/claude-memory` |
| Too many context files | `/cleanup-context` |
| Commit changes | `/commit` |
| Create PR for review | `/create-pull-request` |
| Work on GitHub issue | `/run-tasks` |

The PostPluginInstall hook will automatically copy all commands to `~/.claude/commands/` without overwriting existing commands.

## Integration with SMITE

These commands work seamlessly with SMITE agents:

- Use `/oneshot` with `/builder` for rapid implementation
- Use `/explore` before `/architect` for better design
- Use `/debug` when `/simplifier` finds issues
- Use `/claude-memory` to document SMITE agent conventions
- Use `/commit` after any SMITE agent work

## Command Philosophy

All commands follow these principles:

1. **Clear Purpose**: Each command has a specific, well-defined use case
2. **Structured Workflow**: Repeatable, documented processes
3. **Quality Gates**: Validation and testing phases
4. **User Control**: Approval points for critical decisions
5. **Evidence-Based**: Deep analysis before action
